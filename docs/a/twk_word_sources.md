Word lists were generated using [PetScan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PetScan). I used Wiktionary because it has a lot more weird shit a normal dictionary wouldn't have.

The demonym list was generated using all entries in categories [en:Demonyms](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:en:Demonyms), [en:Demonyms](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:en:Demonyms), and [en:Nationalities](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:en:Nationalities). The list can be found [here](/thosewhoknow/demonyms.js).

The basic verb list was generated using all entries in both the [English verb forms](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_verb_forms) and [English uncountables](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_uncountables) categories. The list can be found [here](/thosewhoknow/verbs.js).

The extended verb list was generated using all [English words ending in -ing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_suffixed_with_-ing). The list can be found [here](/thosewhoknow/verbsExt.js).

The infinitives list was generated using all entries in both the [English verbs](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_verbs) and [English nouns](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_nouns) categories. The list can be found [here](/thosewhoknow/infinitives.js).

There are probably a lot of fucked up things that got caught in the list.
