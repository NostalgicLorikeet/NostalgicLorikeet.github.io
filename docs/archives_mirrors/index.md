title: Archives and mirrors
---
This page is mostly related to mirrors of things that I did *not* make. For archives of stuff that I did make or was involved with, check out the "Old stuff" section on the [sitemap](/sitemap).

- [Gamemaker: Studio 1.4 manual](https://files.hitscan.org/files_two/archives/gms1.4/) - Archive of the old manual from Gamemaker: Studio 1.4, taken from the program's files rather than the website. Web viewable in the "dadiospice" directory.
- [Half-Life 2 Random Map Creator](https://files.hitscan.org/files_two/archives/hl2rmcinstall.zip) - An old HL2 map generator from like 2006. I haven't been able to get it working IIRC, and although its source code was once available appears to be lost. Original site accessible [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20061009132348/http://hl2rmc.hl2files.com).
- [Verizon FiOS Game Pack](https://files.hitscan.org/files_two/archives/Verizon%20FiOS%20Game%20Pack.iso) - A rip of a game disc from Verizon with a bunch of games on it. As far as I can tell I'm probably the only person to have ripped this and put it online.
- [Zero-G Datafiles](https://files.hitscan.org/files_two/samples/Zero-G%20Datafiles/) - Old classic discontinued set of sample discs by Zero-G. Used in a lot of songs from around the 90s-2000s, itself including a lot of uncleared/unauthorized samples.
- [X-Static Goldmine](https://files.hitscan.org/files_two/samples/X-Static%20Goldmine/) - Another old, classic, discontinued, and uncleared set of sample discs. This time a set by the company Polestar Magnetics.
- [X-Pert Media Morbid Minds](https://files.hitscan.org/files_two/samples/X-pert.Media.Morbid.Minds.WAV-ALFiSO/) - A *really* obscure sample CD. Another thing that I'm probably one of the only people hosting an archive of. Found this through a torrent with one really slow seeder I found on some random site.
- [OE Cake](https://files.hitscan.org/files_two/archives/OE-CAKE!.zip) - A 2D physics simulator from around 2008 by the company Prometech Software. Simple but with a surprising amount of depth and a bit of a cult following behind it as well.
