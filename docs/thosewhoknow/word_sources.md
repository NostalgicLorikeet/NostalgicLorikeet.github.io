Word lists were generated using (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PetScan)[PetScan]. I used Wiktionary because it has a lot more weird shit a normal dictionary wouldn't have.

The demonym list was generated using all entries in categories (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:en:Demonyms)[en:Demonyms], (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:en:Demonyms)[en:Demonyms], and (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:en:Nationalities)[en:Nationalities]. The list can be found (/thosewhoknow/demonyms.js)[here].

The basic verb list was generated using all entries in both the (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_verb_forms)[English verb forms] and (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_uncountables)[English uncountables] categories. The list can be found (/thosewhoknow/verbs.js)[here].

The extended verb list was generated using all (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_suffixed_with_-ing)[English words ending in -ing]. The list can be found (/thosewhoknow/verbsExt.js)[here].

The infinitives list was generated using all entries in both the (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_verbs)[English verbs] and (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_nouns)[English nouns] categories. The list can be found (/thosewhoknow/infinitives.js)[here].

There are probably a lot of fucked up things that got caught in the list.
